# <span style="color:#C55911;">Hey Everyone and Full-Stack too, Nice to meet You!</span> 😊
## <span style="color:#264378;">My name is </span><span style="color:#C00000;">Gena Turkot</span><span style="color:#264378;">, I am a Full Stack developer</span> 🍔
<br>

- I speak languages such as *JavaScript, HTML5 CSS3, C#, T-SQL*.
  Besides I love sport and sometimes I'm interested in going through *OOP* and *Design Patterns* villages 🏡 🐕‍🦺🚶‍♂️  

- Over the past few years, I have had the opportunity to dedicate my time 
  to improving and deepening my professional skills and knowledge, and 
  during this process I have written code samples and arranged them into projects 📝

- In these projects, I tried to write down code fragments that could be useful 
  for my further development. And I systematized and published these codes
  in this cool GitHub repository 📚
  The projects’ themes are designed both for Front-And and Back-End.

- I would like to note that I will be very pleased if you will use these my works or will contribute to their gloss 💖 🙏

  *( In addition, I summarized and systematized my educational notes in* 
  *a public repository 📚, and these notes provide a theoretical summary*

  *JavaScript (ES6 and later v.) · HTML5 · CSS3· C# 10 and .NET 6 · OOP · 
  Design Patterns · Responsive Web · CSS Organize · Sass CSS · Web Components · MS Azure · RegEx.*
