Hey everyone and Full-Stack too, 
Nice to meet You! 😊

My name is Gena Turkot, I am a Full Stack developer 🍔🥤

I speak languages such as *JavaScript, HTML5 CSS3, C#, T-SQL*.
Besides I love sport and sometimes I'm interested in going through OOP and Design Patterns villages 🏡 🐕‍🦺🚶‍♂️  

Over the past few years, I have had the opportunity to dedicate my time 
to improving and deepening my professional skills and knowledge, and 
during this process I have written code samples and arranged them into projects 📝

In these projects, I tried to write down code fragments that could be useful 
for my further development. And I systematized and published these codes
in this cool GitHub repository 📚
The projects’ themes are designed both for Front-And and Back-End.

I would like to note that I will be very pleased if you will use these my works or will contribute to their gloss 💖 🙏

(In addition, I summarized and systematized my educational notes in 
a public repository, and these notes provide a theoretical summary 
of subjects such as
*JavaScript (ES6 and later v.) · HTML5 · CSS3· C# 10 and .NET 6 · OOP · 
Design Patterns · Responsive Web · CSS Organize · Sass CSS · Web Components · MS Azure · RegEx.* 
and you are Welcome to have a look in this my [*theoretical-studying-repository*](https:\drive.google.com\drive\folders\1_yyssV9WhXAHwaQ-oSVjc3FBtrFyQM2F))
